General:

fix the music
Printable -> print data of every Renderable clicked on even if several are overlaping
implement pixel-to-pixel location with built-in move function and test it with trains
interatcions menu: continue with trains ; in building mode, display info about current building
Game: in createTown, createRail.. handle player money (ie return false if not enough money, and reduce player's money when building, according to a price)
graph: dijkstra tile by tile
merge Map & TileMap (& Graph?)
add condition when tile is drawn with position & a lil offset


Beautify:

remove useless imports
delete useless printlns and clarify the others
put things at the right place (prices should not be in gamescreen)
_s => caps



Bugs:
