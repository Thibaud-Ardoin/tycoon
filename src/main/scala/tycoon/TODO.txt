General:

fix the music
Printable -> print data of every Renderable clicked on even if several are overlaping
implement pixel-to-pixel location with built-in move function and test it with trains
ui: split left pane into two
graph: tile by tile
merge Map & TileMap (& Graph?)
add condition when tile is drawn with position & a lil offset


Beautify:

remove useless imports
delete useless printlns and clarify the others
put things at the right place (prices should not be in gamescreen)
_s => caps



Bugs:

trains can be bought without money restriction
rails
Exit button closes bad thread and throws exn
