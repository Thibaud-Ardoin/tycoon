DraggableTiledPane:

re-compute offset correctly when zooming/unzooming so that the center of the current screen doesnt move
start with an offset at the center of the map (not top-left corner)
small optimizations (commented around the loops)




Game:

separate code into other classes (one to handle trains, one for towns, one for rails)
TownManager, TrainManager.. inheriting from BasicManager (bc createTrain and createTown are the same)
move all the code about the rails in a RailManager
As there will be an unknown number of vehicles etc, maybe abstract classes VehicleManager, StructureManager..



objects:

create basic classes for each thing to be implemented (with lots of inheritance)
generalize the classes created so far (in Route, Road.. : Train -> Vehicle, Town -> Structure)



ui:

split the left-pane into two: the current only displays information & few static buttonns
+ a new one at the bottom for all the actions because there will be a lot (including a display of every vehicle)
with other windows etc to display info more easily


locations:

implement pixel-to-pixel location with built-in move function and test it with trains


General:

fix the music
remove useless imports
more organized println (displayed where it is printing from), delete the useless ones
put things at the right place (prices should not be i gamescreen)

Printable -> print data of every entity clicked on even if several are overlaping




Bugs:

trains can be bought without money restriction
