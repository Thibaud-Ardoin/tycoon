General:

fix the music
Printable -> print data of every Renderable clicked on even if several are overlaping
implement pixel-to-pixel location with built-in move function and test it with trains
ui: implement canvas
ui: split left pane into two
graph: tile by tile
remove rotate in Tile & add rotated tiles to tileset (also remove inScene, visible's enough, and remove setLayout etc)
simplify tiles just for bg tiles and add sprite which inherits from Tile and includes animation
merge Map & TileMap (& Graph?)


Beautify:

remove useless imports
delete useless printlns and clarify the others
put things at the right place (prices should not be in gamescreen)
_s => caps



Bugs:

trains can be bought without money restriction
rails
Exit button closes bad thread and throws exn
